Monitor the media and other sources for changes to local travelling conditions.</li><li>There is an ongoing threat of terrorism in a number of European countries including Italy. In recent years, terrorist attacks have occurred in major European cities. Exercise caution in public places such as shopping areas, concerts, major events, public transport, airports and other transport hubs. See <a href="#safety_and_security">Safety and security</a>.</li><li>General public and private sector strikes can affect public transport.  See the <a href="http://scioperi.mit.gov.it/mit2/public/scioperi">Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport </a>(in Italian only) for a list of planned strikes. </li><li>During Italy's summer/autumn tourist season, there is a marked increase in the incidence of theft, particularly bag snatching, pickpocketing and vehicle break-ins. When using public transport, including buses, trains and metro, pay close attention to your personal belongings, as pickpocketing is very common on public transport and around transport hubs. </li><li>Italy is located in an active seismic region and experiences a number of earthquakes each year. Significant earthquakes occur occasionally, resulting in damage to infrastructure, homes and property, causing injuries and death. If you're in an affected area, monitor media reports and follow the advice of local authorities. See

                <h2>Entry and exit</h2>
                <span>Italy is party to the Schengen Convention, along with a number of other European countries, which allows Australians to enter Italy without a visa in some circumstances. More information: Schengen Convention.</span>
            </a>

            <div class="detail">
                <div id="right">
                    <div id="sup">
    <p>Visa and other entry and exit conditions (such as currency, customs and quarantine regulations) can change at short notice. Contact the nearest 
        <a href="http://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Mission/view.rails?id=97"> 
        <span>Embassy of Italy</span></a> or visit their

    <p>Ensure that a clearly legible entry stamp is placed in your passport when entering the Schengen Zone (including Italy) for the first time. This stamp marks the start of the 90-day period you're permitted to stay within the Schengen Zone as a tourist. </p>
    <p>Under Italian law, all non-residents are required to complete a 'declaration of presence' (dichiarazione di presenza), regardless of length of stay. Tourists arriving from a non-Schengen-country (e.g. Australia) need to get a stamp in their passport at the airport on the day of arrival. This stamp is considered the equivalent of the 'declaration of presence'. Tourists arriving from a Schengen-country (e.g. France) must request the 'declaration of presence' form from a local police office (commissariato di zona), police headquarters (questura) or their place of stay (e.g hotel, hostel, campgrounds), and submit the form to the police or to their place of stay within eight business days of arrival. If staying in a hotel, this is usually part of the check-in process. Check with your accommodation if you are unsure. Keep a copy of the receipt issued by the Italian authorities. If you don't complete a declaration of presence you can be deported.  </p>
    <p>Under Italian anti-terrorism laws, commercial accommodation providers must provide Italian authorities with the personal details of their guests. In the majority of cases, this will only require taking a photocopy of your passport. </p>
    <p> 
        <strong>Working Holiday Visas</strong>: To work in Italy under the Working Holiday Maker visa program you need to obtain the appropriate visa, prior to travelling to Italy. Be aware of the potential for delays in the processing of mandatory residence and work permits after your arrival in Italy. In some cases, delays of up to several months have been reported. Advise the Australian <a href="http://italy.embassy.gov.au/rome/contact-us.html">Embassy in Rome</a> as soon as possible if you experience difficulties in obtaining residence or work permits under the Working Holiday Make visa program. More information: 
        <a href="http://www.italy.embassy.gov.au/rome/new.html"> 
        W<span>orking holiday visa program information sheet</span></a>.

    <p>Language testing is required as part of the application process for long-term residence permits (permesso di soggiorno). </p>

                <h2>Safety and security</h2>
                <span>Petty crime, including bag snatching, pick-pocketing, passport theft and theft from cars, is common, especially in larger cities, in and around major tourist attractions, on public transport, at major airports, railway stations and bus terminals.</span>
            </a>

            <div class="detail">

    <p>Thieves often work in groups to distract victims and rob them while their attention is diverted. </p>
    <p>Theft is particularly common on trains in Italy, including to and from Fiumicino Airport, near Rome. Thieves use a number of approaches to distract their victims, including: pretending to ask for directions while the train is stopped at a station; dropping attractive items on the floor of the train; blocking the view of luggage stored in overhead luggage racks; and throwing rubbish or ketchup at the victim. Often a member of the group will pretend to come to the assistance of the victim while others make off with the victim's valuables. For more information on train security and crime, see the 
        <a href="http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/view/22329/"> 
        <span>Polizia Di Stato</span></a> website (in English). 
    </p>
    <p>Passengers on night trains have been robbed while sleeping. Be extremely vigilant with your belongings at all times. </p>
    <p>Credit card and ATM fraud involving 'skimming' machines, which can store card data, occurs. Monitor transaction statements and only use ATMs in secure locations such as banks, shops or malls. Police have warned that counterfeit European currency is in circulation. When making purchases, carefully examine any notes you receive in change. </p>
    <p>A number of tourists have been robbed and assaulted after accepting 'spiked' food or drink. In Rome, many of these attacks have taken place around Termini station, tourist areas such as the Colosseum, and in bars and cafes near Campo dei Fiori and Piazza Navona. In Florence and Naples, attacks have occurred in the vicinity of train stations, and in bars and cafes in the city centres. Some victims have been sexually assaulted or have required hospitalisation.</p>
    <p>Robberies from cars at traffic lights, rest stops and service stations occur in Italy. There are reports of thieves slashing tires or staging roadside emergencies to persuade drivers to pull over and get out of their cars. While the driver is distracted, the thieves steal personal belongings. </p>
    <p>Car break-in and theft is also common. Popular targets for thieves are unattended campervans or mobile homes, whether parked at camping sites or in the streets in the vicinity of historic sites. Never leave valuables in your car. When you leave your car, ensure it's locked, even if you will only be away for a short period of time. Many Australians have had their belongings, including passports and other valuables, stolen from unattended vehicles. </p>
    <h3>Civil unrest/Political tension </h3>
    <p>Demonstrations and strikes are a common occurrence in Italy. They can cause building closures, particularly in tourist areas, and disruptions to public transport services, including air, shipping, train, bus, tram and taxi services, roadblocks and petrol station closures, leading to delays and cancellations. The Italian 
        <a href="http://www.mit.gov.it/mit/site.php?p=scioperi"> 
        <span>Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport</span></a> provides information (in Italian) on upcoming strikes. <a href="http://www.trenitalia.com/tcom-en">Trenitalia</a> provides information (in English) on train disruptions. Confirm your flights or travel plans with your travel provider prior to departure, and allow plenty of time for travel to airports and train stations.

                <h2>Local travel</h2>
                <span>Over the last year, there have been significant pressures on border controls in Europe due to the movement of asylum seekers. Carry your passport when crossing borders, even within the Schengen Zone. Monitor local media and other information from transport providers for up-to-date information on entry and exit changes or delays.</span>

    <h3>Public Transport </h3>
    <p>Strikes occur frequently in Italy and can result in delays and cancellations to regular public transport services. See: 
        <a href="/Countries/europe/southern/pages/italy.aspx#safety_and_security"> 
        <span>Civil unrest/Political tensions</span></a>. 
    </p>
    <p>When catching public transport you must validate your ticket prior to boarding a train or a metro, and immediately upon boarding a bus or tram. Failure to validate your ticket can result in on-the-spot fines. In most cities, you're required to pre-purchase bus and train tickets as there are no purchasing facilities once you board a bus or train. Pre-paid tickets are usually available from tobacconists or bars (coffee shops) that display the public transport company's logo/name. Automatic ticket machines are located at every metro and major train station. </p>
    <h3>Driving </h3>
    <p>In Italy, holders of a valid Australian driver's licence, who aren't residents of Italy, may drive for an unlimited period of time provided they have an International Drivers Permit (IDP) or an official translation of the Australian licence. The translation must be prepared by a 'traduttore giurato' (official translator) in Italy. A list of official translators may be found in the 
        <a href="http://www.paginegialle.it/">Italian Yellow Pages</a>. When hiring a car in Italy, you may be required to provide additional ID to your international driver's licence, such as a passport. 
    </p>
    <p>The holder of an Australian licence who takes up legal residence (residenza) can drive on an Australian driver's licence accompanied by the IDP or translation for up to one year only. If you take up residency and remain in Italy beyond one year, you need to apply for an Italian driver's licence. Italy doesn't allow the conversion of an Australian licence, so you will be required to undertake a written test and driving exam conducted in Italian (the exam can be conducted in German or French, under certain circumstances). Australians should contact the 
        <a href="http://protocol.dfat.gov.au/Mission/view.rails?id=97"> 
        <span>Italian Embassy</span></a> in Australia for further information on Italian driver's licence requirements. 
    </p>
    <p>Driving in Italy can be dangerous and driving conditions can seem chaotic compared to Australia. On-the-spot fines are payable for a range of minor traffic offences. It's mandatory to use headlights on main roads outside the urban areas and highways, including during the day. More information:
        <a href="/guide/all-travellers/getting-around/pages/road-safety-and-driving.aspx"> 
        <span>Road safety and driving. </span></a> 
    </p>
    <p>Vehicle access to the centres of many Italian cities are restricted to help reduce congestion. Traffic Restricted Zones (ZTL), and their hours of operation, vary from city to city. Fines are levied on vehicles that don't carry ZTL passes. It's unlikely that hire cars will have a ZTL pass. </p>
    <p>If staying in commercial accommodation in the centre of an Italian city, ask your hotel about traffic restrictions in the area prior to your arrival. For non-residents, the law allows authorities up to five years to identify the person responsible for the infringement and 360 days after the identification to issue the fine. </p>
    <p>Many municipalities have outsourced the collection of traffic fines. European Municipal Outsourcing (EMO) handles the majority of the fines, but fines may be issued by other agencies. Further information on ZTL restrictions can be found on the websites of the individual municipalities (comune). </p>
    <h3>Taxis and travel by foot</h3>
    <p>Always travel in licensed taxis, which can be identified by appropriate signage, roof lights and meters. Unauthorised taxis don't carry meters and charge disproportionately large fares when you reach your destination. </p>
    <p>Pedestrian fatalities are common throughout Italy. Exercise particular care when crossing roads, including at controlled pedestrian crossings. Although required by law, motorists in Italy will often not give way to pedestrians.</p>
    <h3>Air safety </h3>
    <p>The Australian Government doesn't provide information on the safety of individual commercial airlines or flight paths. See the 
        <a href="http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=I"> 
        <span>Aviation Safety Network website</span></a> for information on aviation safety in Italy.
