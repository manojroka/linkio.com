# Content Templates
This is a wordpress plugin for Content Mangagement from the backend, allowing to create four different types of content all managed from the backend.

Plugin Name: Content Templates
Plugin dir: content-templates

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the archive from https://github.com/ajaypag/content-plugin from master branch. 
2. You will get content-plugin folder. This is because we named it so while creating the repo. It would be great to rename it to content-templates to avoid step 3.
3. Rename main folder content-plugin to content-templates since this will be the directory for this plugin.
4. Push it to the plugins directory of your wordpress installation or zip the folder and upload it from backend via Add Plugin Interface. Please make sure there is no .git folder. Its causing problem in some OS while deleting the plugin.
5. Activate the plugin
6. You will get a menu link "Content Templates" on the wordpress admin panel for the user having Editorial access
7. Done ;)
